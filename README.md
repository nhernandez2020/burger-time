# burger-time

This is a single page style web application that allows the user to "devour" preloaded burgers from a database then make them again if desired. It also allows a user to make a custom order(burger), add it to the page by using the input form then hit submit.

How To Use:

To run a local instance of this application clone the repo. Once cloned navigate the the folder in the terminal run npm i or npm install to load all the dependencies needed. In mySQL workbench copy and run schema.sql to create the database needed to run. After the database is created and the dependencies are installed, on config/connection.js change the database configuration needed for the SQL server to run locally. When that is saved run the command node server to start the server then navigate to localhost:8080/ and the page will be displayed.
